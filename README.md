# Lab 10

## Directions

You will be using the Stack ADT to convert an existing recursive function into an iterative version. The `ArrayStack` class is already given to you, as well as a main driver file. Your job is to implement the `gStack` function. The idea is to mimic the recursion by using stacks and loops. When you run the program, the output from your stack-based iterative version should match up exactly with the recursive one. I encourage you to start with small starting values and then work your way up.
